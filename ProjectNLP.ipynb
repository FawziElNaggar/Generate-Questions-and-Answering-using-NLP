              "'Marketing\\nMarketing is the process of intentionally stimulating demand for and purchases of goods and services; potentially including selection of a target audience; selection of certain attributes or themes to emphasize in advertising; operation of advertising campaigns; attendance at trade shows and public events; design of products and packaging to be more attractive to buyers; selection of the terms of sale, such as price, discounts, warranty, and return policy; product placement in media or with people believed to influence the buying habits of others; agreements with retailers, wholesale distributors, or resellers; and attempts to create awareness of, loyalty to, and positive feelings about a brand. Marketing is typically conducted by the seller, typically a retailer or manufacturer. Sometimes tasks are contracted to a dedicated marketing firm or advertising agency. More rarely, a trade association or government agency (such as the Agricultural Marketing Service) advertises on behalf of an entire industry or locality, often a specific type of food (e.g. Got Milk?), food from a specific area, or a city or region as a tourism destination.\\n\\nIt is one of the primary components of business management and commerce.[1] Marketers can direct their product to other businesses (B2B marketing) or directly to consumers (B2C marketing).[2] Regardless of who is being marketed to, several factors apply, including the perspective the marketers will use. Known as market orientations, they determine how marketers will approach the planning stage of marketing.[3]\\n\\nThe marketing mix, which outlines the specifics of the product and how it will be sold,[4][5] is affected by the environment surrounding the product,[6] the results of marketing research and market research,[7][8] and the characteristics of the product\\'s target market.[9] Once these factors are determined, marketers must then decide what methods will be used to promote the product,[2] including use of coupons and other price inducements.[10]\\n\\nThe term marketing, what is commonly known as attracting customers, incorporates knowledge gained by studying the management of exchange relationships[11][12] and is the business process of identifying, anticipating and satisfying customers\\' needs and wants.\\nMarketing is currently defined by the American Marketing Association (AMA) as \"the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large\".[13] However, the definition of marketing has evolved over the years. The AMA reviews this definition and its definition for \"marketing research\" every three years.[13] The interests of \"society at large\" were added into the definition in 2008.[14] The development of the definition may be seen by comparing the 2008 definition with the AMA\\'s 1935 version: \"Marketing is the performance of business activities that direct the flow of goods, and services from producers to consumers\".[15] The newer definition highlights the increased prominence of other stakeholders in the new conception of marketing.\\n\\nRecent definitions of marketing place more emphasis on the consumer relationship, as opposed to a pure exchange process. For instance, prolific marketing author and educator, Philip Kotler has evolved his definition of marketing. In 1980, he defined marketing as \"satisfying needs and wants through an exchange process\",[16] and in 2018 defined it as \"the process by which companies engage customers, build strong customer relationships, and create customer value in order to capture value from customers in return\".[17] A related definition, from the sales process engineering perspective, defines marketing as \"a set of processes that are interconnected and interdependent with other functions of a business aimed at achieving customer interest and satisfaction\".[18]\\n\\nBesides, customers some definitions of marketing highlight marketing\\'s ability to produce value to shareholders of the firm as well. In this context, marketing can be defined as \"the management process that seeks to maximise returns to shareholders by developing relationships with valued customers and creating a competitive advantage\".[19] For instance, the Chartered Institute of Marketing defines marketing from a customer-centric perspective, focusing on \"the management process responsible for identifying, anticipating and satisfying customer requirements profitably\".[20]\\n\\nIn the past, marketing practice tended to be seen as a creative industry, which included advertising, distribution and selling, and even today many parts of the marketing process (e.g. product design, art director, brand management, advertising, inbound marketing, copywriting etc.) involve the use of the creative arts.[21] However, because marketing makes extensive use of social sciences, psychology, sociology, mathematics, economics, anthropology and neuroscience, the profession is now widely recognized as a science.[22] Marketing science has developed a concrete process that can be followed to create a marketing plan.[23]\\n\\nThe \"marketing concept\" proposes that to complete its organizational objectives, an organization should anticipate the needs and wants of potential consumers and satisfy them more effectively than its competitors. This concept originated from Adam Smith\\'s book The Wealth of Nations but would not become widely used until nearly 200 years later.[24] Marketing and Marketing Concepts are directly related.\\n\\nGiven the centrality of customer needs, and wants in marketing, a rich understanding of these concepts is essential:[25]\\n\\nNeeds: Something necessary for people to live a healthy, stable and safe life. When needs remain unfulfilled, there is a clear adverse outcome: a dysfunction or death. Needs can be objective and physical, such as the need for food, water, and shelter; or subjective and psychological, such as the need to belong to a family or social group and the need for self-esteem.\\nWants: Something that is desired, wished for or aspired to. Wants are not essential for basic survival and are often shaped by culture or peer-groups.\\nDemands: When needs and wants are backed by the ability to pay, they have the potential to become economic demands.\\nMarketing research, conducted for the purpose of new product development or product improvement, is often concerned with identifying the consumer\\'s unmet needs.[26] Customer needs are central to market segmentation which is concerned with dividing markets into distinct groups of buyers on the basis of \"distinct needs, characteristics, or behaviors who might require separate products or marketing mixes.\"[27] Needs-based segmentation (also known as benefit segmentation) \"places the customers\\' desires at the forefront of how a company designs and markets products or services.\"[28] Although needs-based segmentation is difficult to do in practice, it has been proved to be one of the most effective ways to segment a market.[29][26] In addition, a great deal of advertising and promotion is designed to show how a given product\\'s benefits meet the customer\\'s needs, wants or expectations in a unique way.[30]\\n\\nB2B and B2C Marketing\\nThe two major segments of marketing are business-to-business (B2B) marketing and business-to-consumer (B2C) marketing.[2]\\n\\nB2B marketing\\nB2B (business-to-business) marketing refers to any marketing strategy or content that is geared towards a business or organization. Any company that sells products or services to other businesses or organizations (vs. consumers) typically uses B2B marketing strategies.\\n\\nExamples of products sold through B2B marketing include:\\n\\nMajor equipment\\nAccessory equipment\\nRaw materials\\nComponent parts\\nProcessed materials\\nSupplies\\nBusiness services[2]\\nThe four major categories of B2B product purchasers are:\\n\\nProducers- use products sold by B2B marketing to make their own goods (e.g.: Mattel buying plastics to make toys)\\nResellers- buy B2B products to sell through retail or wholesale establishments (e.g.: Walmart buying vacuums to sell in stores)\\nGovernments- buy B2B products for use in government projects (e.g.: purchasing contractor services to repair infrastructure)\\nInstitutions- use B2B products to continue operation (e.g.: schools buying printers for office use)[2]\\nB2C marketing\\nBusiness-to-consumer marketing, or B2C marketing, refers to the tactics and strategies in which a company promotes its products and services to individual people.\\n\\nTraditionally, this could refer to individuals shopping for personal products in a broad sense. More recently the term B2C refers to the online selling of consumer products.[31]\\n\\nC2B marketing\\nConsumer-to-business marketing or C2B marketing is a business model where the end consumers create products and services which are consumed by businesses and organizations. It is diametrically opposed to the popular concept of B2C or Business- to- Consumer where the companies make goods and services available to the end consumers.\\n\\nC2C marketing\\nCustomer to customer marketing or C2C marketing represents a market environment where one customer purchases goods from another customer using a third-party business or platform to facilitate the transaction. C2C companies are a new type of model that has emerged with e-commerce technology and the sharing economy.[32]\\n\\nDifferences in B2B and B2C marketing\\nThe different goals of B2B and B2C marketing lead to differences in the B2B and B2C markets. The main differences in these markets are demand, purchasing volume, number of customers, customer concentration, distribution, buying nature, buying influences, negotiations, reciprocity, leasing and promotional methods.[2]\\n\\nDemand: B2B demand is derived because businesses buy products based on how much demand there is for the final consumer product. Businesses buy products based on customer\\'s wants and needs. B2C demand is primarily because customers buy products based on their own wants and needs.[2]\\nPurchasing volume: Businesses buy products in large volumes to distribute to consumers. Consumers buy products in smaller volumes suitable for personal use.[2]\\nNumber of customers: There are relatively fewer businesses to market to than direct consumers.[2]\\nCustomer concentration: Businesses that specialize in a particular market tend to be geographically concentrated while customers that buy products from these businesses are not concentrated.[2]\\nDistribution: B2B products pass directly from the producer of the product to the business while B2C products must additionally go through a wholesaler or retailer.[2]\\nBuying nature: B2B purchasing is a formal process done by professional buyers and sellers, while B2C purchasing is informal.[2]\\nBuying influences: B2B purchasing is influenced by multiple people in various departments such as quality control, accounting, and logistics while B2C marketing is only influenced by the person making the purchase and possibly a few others.[2]\\nNegotiations: In B2B marketing, negotiating for lower prices or added benefits is commonly accepted while in B2C marketing (particularly in Western cultures) prices are fixed.[2]\\nReciprocity: Businesses tend to buy from businesses they sell to. For example, a business that sells printer ink is more likely to buy office chairs from a supplier that buys the business\\'s printer ink. In B2C marketing, this does not occur because consumers are not also selling products.[2]\\nLeasing: Businesses tend to lease expensive items while consumers tend to save up to buy expensive items.[2]\\nPromotional methods: In B2B marketing, the most common promotional method is personal selling. B2C marketing mostly uses sales promotion, public relations, advertising, and social media.[2]\\nMarketing Management Orientations\\nMain article: History of marketing § Orientations or philosophies that inform marketing practice\\nA marketing orientation has been defined as a \"philosophy of business management.\"[3] or \"a corporate state of mind\"[33] or as an \"organisation[al] culture\"[34] Although scholars continue to debate the precise nature of specific concepts that inform marketing practice, the most commonly cited orientations are as follows:[35]\\n\\nProduct concept: mainly concerned with the quality of its product. It has largely been supplanted by the marketing orientation, except for haute couture and arts marketing.[36][37]\\nProduction concept: specializes in producing as much as possible of a given product or service in order to achieve economies of scale or economies of scope. It dominated marketing practice from the 1860s to the 1930s, yet can still be found in some companies or industries. Specifically, Kotler and Armstrong note that the production philosophy is \"one of the oldest philosophies that guides sellers... [and] is still useful in some situations.\"[38]\\nSelling concept: focuses on the selling/promotion of the firm\\'s existing products, rather than developing new products to satisfy unmet needs or wants primarily through promotion and direct sales techniques,[39] largely for \"unsought goods\"[40] in industrial companies.[41] A 2011 meta analyses[42] found that the factors with the greatest impact on sales performance are a salesperson\\'s sales related knowledge (market segments, presentation skills, conflict resolution, and products), degree of adaptiveness, role clarity, cognitive aptitude, motivation and interest in a sales role).\\nMarketing concept: This is the most common concept used in contemporary marketing, and is a customer-centric approach based on products that suit new consumer tastes. These firm engage in extensive market research, use R&D (Research & Development), and then utilize promotion techniques.[43][44] The marketing orientation includes:\\nCustomer orientation: A firm in the market economy can survive by producing goods that people are willing and able to buy. Consequently, ascertaining consumer demand is vital for a firm\\'s future viability and even existence as a going concern.\\nOrganizational orientation: The marketing department is of prime importance within the functional level of an organization. Information from the marketing department is used to guide the actions of a company\\'s other departments. A marketing department could ascertain (via marketing research) that consumers desired a new type of product, or a new usage for an existing product. With this in mind, the marketing department would inform the R&D department to create a prototype of a product/service based on consumers\\' new desires. The production department would then start to manufacture the product. The finance department may oppose required capital expenditures since it could undermine a healthy cash flow for the organization.\\nSocietal marketing concept: Social responsibility that goes beyond satisfying customers and providing superior value embraces societal stakeholders such as employees, customers, and local communities. Companies that adopt this perspective typically practice triple bottom line reporting and publish financial, social and environmental impact reports. Sustainable marketing or green marketing is an extension of societal marketing.[45]\\nThe Marketing Mix\\nMain article: Marketing mix\\nA marketing mix is a foundational tool used to guide decision making in marketing. The marketing mix represents the basic tools that marketers can use to bring their products or services to the market. They are the foundation of managerial marketing and the marketing plan typically devotes a section to the marketing mix.\\n\\nThe 4Cs\\nIn response to environmental and technological changes in marketing, as well as criticisms towards the 4Ps approach, the 4Cs has emerged as a modern marketing mix model.\\n\\nOutline\\nConsumer (or Client)\\n\\nThe consumer refers to the person or group that will acquire the product. This aspect of the model focuses on fulfilling the wants or needs of the consumer.[5]\\n\\nCost\\n\\nCost refers to what is exchanged in return for the product. Cost mainly consists of the monetary value of the product. Cost also refers to anything else the consumer must sacrifice to attain the product, such as time or money spent on transportation to acquire the product.[5]\\n\\nConvenience\\n\\nLike \"Place\" in the 4Ps model, convenience refers to where the product will be sold. This, however, not only refers to physical stores but also whether the product is available in person or online. The convenience aspect emphasizes making it as easy as possible for the consumer to attain the product, thus making them more likely to do so.[5]\\n\\nCommunication\\n\\nLike \"Promotion\" in the 4Ps model, communication refers to how consumers find out about a product. Unlike promotion, communication not only refers to the one-way communication of advertising, but also the two-way communication available through social media.[5]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'"

            "marketing is the process of intentionally stimulating demand for and purchases of goods and services; potentially including selection of a target audience; selection of certain attributes or themes to emphasize in advertising; operation of advertising campaigns; attendance at trade shows and public events; design of products and packaging to be more attractive to buyers; selection of the terms of sale, such as price, discounts, warranty, and return policy; product placement in media or with people believed to influence the buying habits of others; agreements with retailers, wholesale distributors, or resellers; and attempts to create awareness of, loyalty to, and positive feelings about a brand. marketing is typically conducted by the seller, typically a retailer or manufacturer. sometimes tasks are contracted to a dedicated marketing firm or advertising agency. more rarely, a trade association or government agency (such as the agricultural marketing service) advertises on behalf of an entire industry or locality, often a specific type of food (e.g. got milk?), food from a specific area, or a city or region as a tourism destination.\n",

            "recent definitions of marketing place more emphasis on the consumer relationship, as opposed to a pure exchange process. for instance, prolific marketing author and educator, philip kotler has evolved his definition of marketing. in 1980, he defined marketing as \"satisfying needs and wants through an exchange process\",[16] and in 2018 defined it as \"the process by which companies engage customers, build strong customer relationships, and create customer value in order to capture value from customers in return\".[17] a related definition, from the sales process engineering perspective, defines marketing as \"a set of processes that are interconnected and interdependent with other functions of a business aimed at achieving customer interest and satisfaction\".[18]\n",

              "'marketing\\nmarketing is the process of intentionally stimulating demand for and purchases of goods and services; potentially including selection of a target audience; selection of certain attributes or themes to emphasize in advertising; operation of advertising campaigns; attendance at trade shows and public events; design of products and packaging to be more attractive to buyers; selection of the terms of sale, such as price, discounts, warranty, and return policy; product placement in media or with people believed to influence the buying habits of others; agreements with retailers, wholesale distributors, or resellers; and attempts to create awareness of, loyalty to, and positive feelings about a brand. marketing is typically conducted by the seller, typically a retailer or manufacturer. sometimes tasks are contracted to a dedicated marketing firm or advertising agency. more rarely, a trade association or government agency (such as the agricultural marketing service) advertises on behalf of an entire industry or locality, often a specific type of food (e.g. got milk?), food from a specific area, or a city or region as a tourism destination.\\n\\nit is one of the primary components of business management and commerce.[1] marketers can direct their product to other businesses (b2b marketing) or directly to consumers (b2c marketing).[2] regardless of who is being marketed to, several factors apply, including the perspective the marketers will use. known as market orientations, they determine how marketers will approach the planning stage of marketing.[3]\\n\\nthe marketing mix, which outlines the specifics of the product and how it will be sold,[4][5] is affected by the environment surrounding the product,[6] the results of marketing research and market research,[7][8] and the characteristics of the product\\'s target market.[9] once these factors are determined, marketers must then decide what methods will be used to promote the product,[2] including use of coupons and other price inducements.[10]\\n\\nthe term marketing, what is commonly known as attracting customers, incorporates knowledge gained by studying the management of exchange relationships[11][12] and is the business process of identifying, anticipating and satisfying customers\\' needs and wants.\\nmarketing is currently defined by the american marketing association (ama) as \"the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large\".[13] however, the definition of marketing has evolved over the years. the ama reviews this definition and its definition for \"marketing research\" every three years.[13] the interests of \"society at large\" were added into the definition in 2008.[14] the development of the definition may be seen by comparing the 2008 definition with the ama\\'s 1935 version: \"marketing is the performance of business activities that direct the flow of goods, and services from producers to consumers\".[15] the newer definition highlights the increased prominence of other stakeholders in the new conception of marketing.\\n\\nrecent definitions of marketing place more emphasis on the consumer relationship, as opposed to a pure exchange process. for instance, prolific marketing author and educator, philip kotler has evolved his definition of marketing. in 1980, he defined marketing as \"satisfying needs and wants through an exchange process\",[16] and in 2018 defined it as \"the process by which companies engage customers, build strong customer relationships, and create customer value in order to capture value from customers in return\".[17] a related definition, from the sales process engineering perspective, defines marketing as \"a set of processes that are interconnected and interdependent with other functions of a business aimed at achieving customer interest and satisfaction\".[18]\\n\\nbesides, customers some definitions of marketing highlight marketing\\'s ability to produce value to shareholders of the firm as well. in this context, marketing can be defined as \"the management process that seeks to maximise returns to shareholders by developing relationships with valued customers and creating a competitive advantage\".[19] for instance, the chartered institute of marketing defines marketing from a customer-centric perspective, focusing on \"the management process responsible for identifying, anticipating and satisfying customer requirements profitably\".[20]\\n\\nin the past, marketing practice tended to be seen as a creative industry, which included advertising, distribution and selling, and even today many parts of the marketing process (e.g. product design, art director, brand management, advertising, inbound marketing, copywriting etc.) involve the use of the creative arts.[21] however, because marketing makes extensive use of social sciences, psychology, sociology, mathematics, economics, anthropology and neuroscience, the profession is now widely recognized as a science.[22] marketing science has developed a concrete process that can be followed to create a marketing plan.[23]\\n\\nthe \"marketing concept\" proposes that to complete its organizational objectives, an organization should anticipate the needs and wants of potential consumers and satisfy them more effectively than its competitors. this concept originated from adam smith\\'s book the wealth of nations but would not become widely used until nearly 200 years later.[24] marketing and marketing concepts are directly related.\\n\\ngiven the centrality of customer needs, and wants in marketing, a rich understanding of these concepts is essential:[25]\\n\\nneeds: something necessary for people to live a healthy, stable and safe life. when needs remain unfulfilled, there is a clear adverse outcome: a dysfunction or death. needs can be objective and physical, such as the need for food, water, and shelter; or subjective and psychological, such as the need to belong to a family or social group and the need for self-esteem.\\nwants: something that is desired, wished for or aspired to. wants are not essential for basic survival and are often shaped by culture or peer-groups.\\ndemands: when needs and wants are backed by the ability to pay, they have the potential to become economic demands.\\nmarketing research, conducted for the purpose of new product development or product improvement, is often concerned with identifying the consumer\\'s unmet needs.[26] customer needs are central to market segmentation which is concerned with dividing markets into distinct groups of buyers on the basis of \"distinct needs, characteristics, or behaviors who might require separate products or marketing mixes.\"[27] needs-based segmentation (also known as benefit segmentation) \"places the customers\\' desires at the forefront of how a company designs and markets products or services.\"[28] although needs-based segmentation is difficult to do in practice, it has been proved to be one of the most effective ways to segment a market.[29][26] in addition, a great deal of advertising and promotion is designed to show how a given product\\'s benefits meet the customer\\'s needs, wants or expectations in a unique way.[30]\\n\\nb2b and b2c marketing\\nthe two major segments of marketing are business-to-business (b2b) marketing and business-to-consumer (b2c) marketing.[2]\\n\\nb2b marketing\\nb2b (business-to-business) marketing refers to any marketing strategy or content that is geared towards a business or organization. any company that sells products or services to other businesses or organizations (vs. consumers) typically uses b2b marketing strategies.\\n\\nexamples of products sold through b2b marketing include:\\n\\nmajor equipment\\naccessory equipment\\nraw materials\\ncomponent parts\\nprocessed materials\\nsupplies\\nbusiness services[2]\\nthe four major categories of b2b product purchasers are:\\n\\nproducers- use products sold by b2b marketing to make their own goods (e.g.: mattel buying plastics to make toys)\\nresellers- buy b2b products to sell through retail or wholesale establishments (e.g.: walmart buying vacuums to sell in stores)\\ngovernments- buy b2b products for use in government projects (e.g.: purchasing contractor services to repair infrastructure)\\ninstitutions- use b2b products to continue operation (e.g.: schools buying printers for office use)[2]\\nb2c marketing\\nbusiness-to-consumer marketing, or b2c marketing, refers to the tactics and strategies in which a company promotes its products and services to individual people.\\n\\ntraditionally, this could refer to individuals shopping for personal products in a broad sense. more recently the term b2c refers to the online selling of consumer products.[31]\\n\\nc2b marketing\\nconsumer-to-business marketing or c2b marketing is a business model where the end consumers create products and services which are consumed by businesses and organizations. it is diametrically opposed to the popular concept of b2c or business- to- consumer where the companies make goods and services available to the end consumers.\\n\\nc2c marketing\\ncustomer to customer marketing or c2c marketing represents a market environment where one customer purchases goods from another customer using a third-party business or platform to facilitate the transaction. c2c companies are a new type of model that has emerged with e-commerce technology and the sharing economy.[32]\\n\\ndifferences in b2b and b2c marketing\\nthe different goals of b2b and b2c marketing lead to differences in the b2b and b2c markets. the main differences in these markets are demand, purchasing volume, number of customers, customer concentration, distribution, buying nature, buying influences, negotiations, reciprocity, leasing and promotional methods.[2]\\n\\ndemand: b2b demand is derived because businesses buy products based on how much demand there is for the final consumer product. businesses buy products based on customer\\'s wants and needs. b2c demand is primarily because customers buy products based on their own wants and needs.[2]\\npurchasing volume: businesses buy products in large volumes to distribute to consumers. consumers buy products in smaller volumes suitable for personal use.[2]\\nnumber of customers: there are relatively fewer businesses to market to than direct consumers.[2]\\ncustomer concentration: businesses that specialize in a particular market tend to be geographically concentrated while customers that buy products from these businesses are not concentrated.[2]\\ndistribution: b2b products pass directly from the producer of the product to the business while b2c products must additionally go through a wholesaler or retailer.[2]\\nbuying nature: b2b purchasing is a formal process done by professional buyers and sellers, while b2c purchasing is informal.[2]\\nbuying influences: b2b purchasing is influenced by multiple people in various departments such as quality control, accounting, and logistics while b2c marketing is only influenced by the person making the purchase and possibly a few others.[2]\\nnegotiations: in b2b marketing, negotiating for lower prices or added benefits is commonly accepted while in b2c marketing (particularly in western cultures) prices are fixed.[2]\\nreciprocity: businesses tend to buy from businesses they sell to. for example, a business that sells printer ink is more likely to buy office chairs from a supplier that buys the business\\'s printer ink. in b2c marketing, this does not occur because consumers are not also selling products.[2]\\nleasing: businesses tend to lease expensive items while consumers tend to save up to buy expensive items.[2]\\npromotional methods: in b2b marketing, the most common promotional method is personal selling. b2c marketing mostly uses sales promotion, public relations, advertising, and social media.[2]\\nmarketing management orientations\\nmain article: history of marketing § orientations or philosophies that inform marketing practice\\na marketing orientation has been defined as a \"philosophy of business management.\"[3] or \"a corporate state of mind\"[33] or as an \"organisation[al] culture\"[34] although scholars continue to debate the precise nature of specific concepts that inform marketing practice, the most commonly cited orientations are as follows:[35]\\n\\nproduct concept: mainly concerned with the quality of its product. it has largely been supplanted by the marketing orientation, except for haute couture and arts marketing.[36][37]\\nproduction concept: specializes in producing as much as possible of a given product or service in order to achieve economies of scale or economies of scope. it dominated marketing practice from the 1860s to the 1930s, yet can still be found in some companies or industries. specifically, kotler and armstrong note that the production philosophy is \"one of the oldest philosophies that guides sellers... [and] is still useful in some situations.\"[38]\\nselling concept: focuses on the selling/promotion of the firm\\'s existing products, rather than developing new products to satisfy unmet needs or wants primarily through promotion and direct sales techniques,[39] largely for \"unsought goods\"[40] in industrial companies.[41] a 2011 meta analyses[42] found that the factors with the greatest impact on sales performance are a salesperson\\'s sales related knowledge (market segments, presentation skills, conflict resolution, and products), degree of adaptiveness, role clarity, cognitive aptitude, motivation and interest in a sales role).\\nmarketing concept: this is the most common concept used in contemporary marketing, and is a customer-centric approach based on products that suit new consumer tastes. these firm engage in extensive market research, use r&d (research & development), and then utilize promotion techniques.[43][44] the marketing orientation includes:\\ncustomer orientation: a firm in the market economy can survive by producing goods that people are willing and able to buy. consequently, ascertaining consumer demand is vital for a firm\\'s future viability and even existence as a going concern.\\norganizational orientation: the marketing department is of prime importance within the functional level of an organization. information from the marketing department is used to guide the actions of a company\\'s other departments. a marketing department could ascertain (via marketing research) that consumers desired a new type of product, or a new usage for an existing product. with this in mind, the marketing department would inform the r&d department to create a prototype of a product/service based on consumers\\' new desires. the production department would then start to manufacture the product. the finance department may oppose required capital expenditures since it could undermine a healthy cash flow for the organization.\\nsocietal marketing concept: social responsibility that goes beyond satisfying customers and providing superior value embraces societal stakeholders such as employees, customers, and local communities. companies that adopt this perspective typically practice triple bottom line reporting and publish financial, social and environmental impact reports. sustainable marketing or green marketing is an extension of societal marketing.[45]\\nthe marketing mix\\nmain article: marketing mix\\na marketing mix is a foundational tool used to guide decision making in marketing. the marketing mix represents the basic tools that marketers can use to bring their products or services to the market. they are the foundation of managerial marketing and the marketing plan typically devotes a section to the marketing mix.\\n\\nthe 4cs\\nin response to environmental and technological changes in marketing, as well as criticisms towards the 4ps approach, the 4cs has emerged as a modern marketing mix model.\\n\\noutline\\nconsumer (or client)\\n\\nthe consumer refers to the person or group that will acquire the product. this aspect of the model focuses on fulfilling the wants or needs of the consumer.[5]\\n\\ncost\\n\\ncost refers to what is exchanged in return for the product. cost mainly consists of the monetary value of the product. cost also refers to anything else the consumer must sacrifice to attain the product, such as time or money spent on transportation to acquire the product.[5]\\n\\nconvenience\\n\\nlike \"place\" in the 4ps model, convenience refers to where the product will be sold. this, however, not only refers to physical stores but also whether the product is available in person or online. the convenience aspect emphasizes making it as easy as possible for the consumer to attain the product, thus making them more likely to do so.[5]\\n\\ncommunication\\n\\nlike \"promotion\" in the 4ps model, communication refers to how consumers find out about a product. unlike promotion, communication not only refers to the one-way communication of advertising, but also the two-way communication available through social media.[5]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'"

            "\n",
            "product concept: mainly concerned with the quality of its product. it has largely been supplanted by the marketing orientation, except for haute couture and arts marketing.[36][37]\n",
            "production concept: specializes in producing as much as possible of a given product or service in order to achieve economies of scale or economies of scope. it dominated marketing practice from the 1860s to the 1930s, yet can still be found in some companies or industries. specifically, kotler and armstrong note that the production philosophy is \"one of the oldest philosophies that guides sellers... [and] is still useful in some situations.\"[38]\n",
            "selling concept: focuses on the selling/promotion of the firm's existing products, rather than developing new products to satisfy unmet needs or wants primarily through promotion and direct sales techniques,[39] largely for \"unsought goods\"[40] in industrial companies.[41] a 2011 meta analyses[42] found that the factors with the greatest impact on sales performance are a salesperson's sales related knowledge (market segments, presentation skills, conflict resolution, and products), degree of adaptiveness, role clarity, cognitive aptitude, motivation and interest in a sales role).\n",
            "marketing concept: this is the most common concept used in contemporary marketing, and is a customer-centric approach based on products that suit new consumer tastes. these firm engage in extensive market research, use r&d (research & development), and then utilize promotion techniques.[43][44] the marketing orientation includes:\n",
            "customer orientation: a firm in the market economy can survive by producing goods that people are willing and able to buy. consequently, ascertaining consumer demand is vital for a firm's future viability and even existence as a going concern.\n",
            "organizational orientation: the marketing department is of prime importance within the functional level of an organization. information from the marketing department is used to guide the actions of a company's other departments. a marketing department could ascertain (via marketing research) that consumers desired a new type of product, or a new usage for an existing product. with this in mind, the marketing department would inform the r&d department to create a prototype of a product/service based on consumers' new desires. the production department would then start to manufacture the product. the finance department may oppose required capital expenditures since it could undermine a healthy cash flow for the organization.\n",
            "societal marketing concept: social responsibility that goes beyond satisfying customers and providing superior value embraces societal stakeholders such as employees, customers, and local communities. companies that adopt this perspective typically practice triple bottom line reporting and publish financial, social and environmental impact reports. sustainable marketing or green marketing is an extension of societal marketing.[45]\n",

              "'marketing\\nmarketing is the process of intentionally stimulating demand for and purchases of goods and services; potentially including selection of a target audience; selection of certain attributes or themes to emphasize in advertising; operation of advertising campaigns; attendance at trade shows and public events; design of products and packaging to be more attractive to buyers; selection of the terms of sale, such as price, discounts, warranty, and return policy; product placement in media or with people believed to influence the buying habits of others; agreements with retailers, wholesale distributors, or resellers; and attempts to create awareness of, loyalty to, and positive feelings about a brand. marketing is typically conducted by the seller, typically a retailer or manufacturer. sometimes tasks are contracted to a dedicated marketing firm or advertising agency. more rarely, a trade association or government agency (such as the agricultural marketing service) advertises on behalf of an entire industry or locality, often a specific type of food (e.g. got milk?), food from a specific area, or a city or region as a tourism destination.\\n\\nit is one of the primary components of business management and commerce.[1] marketers can direct their product to other businesses (b2b marketing) or directly to consumers (b2c marketing).[2] regardless of who is being marketed to, several factors apply, including the perspective the marketers will use. known as market orientations, they determine how marketers will approach the planning stage of marketing.[3]\\n\\nthe marketing mix, which outlines the specifics of the product and how it will be sold,[4][5] is affected by the environment surrounding the product,[6] the results of marketing research and market research,[7][8] and the characteristics of the product\\'s target market.[9] once these factors are determined, marketers must then decide what methods will be used to promote the product,[2] including use of coupons and other price inducements.[10]\\n\\nthe term marketing, what is commonly known as attracting customers, incorporates knowledge gained by studying the management of exchange relationships[11][12] and is the business process of identifying, anticipating and satisfying customers\\' needs and wants.\\nmarketing is currently defined by the american marketing association (ama) as \"the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large\".[13] however, the definition of marketing has evolved over the years. the ama reviews this definition and its definition for \"marketing research\" every three years.[13] the interests of \"society at large\" were added into the definition in 2008.[14] the development of the definition may be seen by comparing the 2008 definition with the ama\\'s 1935 version: \"marketing is the performance of business activities that direct the flow of goods, and services from producers to consumers\".[15] the newer definition highlights the increased prominence of other stakeholders in the new conception of marketing.\\n\\nrecent definitions of marketing place more emphasis on the consumer relationship, as opposed to a pure exchange process. for instance, prolific marketing author and educator, philip kotler has evolved his definition of marketing. in 1980, he defined marketing as \"satisfying needs and wants through an exchange process\",[16] and in 2018 defined it as \"the process by which companies engage customers, build strong customer relationships, and create customer value in order to capture value from customers in return\".[17] a related definition, from the sales process engineering perspective, defines marketing as \"a set of processes that are interconnected and interdependent with other functions of a business aimed at achieving customer interest and satisfaction\".[18]\\n\\nbesides, customers some definitions of marketing highlight marketing\\'s ability to produce value to shareholders of the firm as well. in this context, marketing can be defined as \"the management process that seeks to maximise returns to shareholders by developing relationships with valued customers and creating a competitive advantage\".[19] for instance, the chartered institute of marketing defines marketing from a customer-centric perspective, focusing on \"the management process responsible for identifying, anticipating and satisfying customer requirements profitably\".[20]\\n\\nin the past, marketing practice tended to be seen as a creative industry, which included advertising, distribution and selling, and even today many parts of the marketing process (e.g. product design, art director, brand management, advertising, inbound marketing, copywriting etc.) involve the use of the creative arts.[21] however, because marketing makes extensive use of social sciences, psychology, sociology, mathematics, economics, anthropology and neuroscience, the profession is now widely recognized as a science.[22] marketing science has developed a concrete process that can be followed to create a marketing plan.[23]\\n\\nthe \"marketing concept\" proposes that to complete its organizational objectives, an organization should anticipate the needs and wants of potential consumers and satisfy them more effectively than its competitors. this concept originated from adam smith\\'s book the wealth of nations but would not become widely used until nearly 200 years later.[24] marketing and marketing concepts are directly related.\\n\\ngiven the centrality of customer needs, and wants in marketing, a rich understanding of these concepts is essential:[25]\\n\\nneeds: something necessary for people to live a healthy, stable and safe life. when needs remain unfulfilled, there is a clear adverse outcome: a dysfunction or death. needs can be objective and physical, such as the need for food, water, and shelter; or subjective and psychological, such as the need to belong to a family or social group and the need for self-esteem.\\nwants: something that is desired, wished for or aspired to. wants are not essential for basic survival and are often shaped by culture or peer-groups.\\ndemands: when needs and wants are backed by the ability to pay, they have the potential to become economic demands.\\nmarketing research, conducted for the purpose of new product development or product improvement, is often concerned with identifying the consumer\\'s unmet needs.[26] customer needs are central to market segmentation which is concerned with dividing markets into distinct groups of buyers on the basis of \"distinct needs, characteristics, or behaviors who might require separate products or marketing mixes.\"[27] needs-based segmentation (also known as benefit segmentation) \"places the customers\\' desires at the forefront of how a company designs and markets products or services.\"[28] although needs-based segmentation is difficult to do in practice, it has been proved to be one of the most effective ways to segment a market.[29][26] in addition, a great deal of advertising and promotion is designed to show how a given product\\'s benefits meet the customer\\'s needs, wants or expectations in a unique way.[30]\\n\\nb2b and b2c marketing\\nthe two major segments of marketing are business-to-business (b2b) marketing and business-to-consumer (b2c) marketing.[2]\\n\\nb2b marketing\\nb2b (business-to-business) marketing refers to any marketing strategy or content that is geared towards a business or organization. any company that sells products or services to other businesses or organizations (vs. consumers) typically uses b2b marketing strategies.\\n\\nexamples of products sold through b2b marketing include:\\n\\nmajor equipment\\naccessory equipment\\nraw materials\\ncomponent parts\\nprocessed materials\\nsupplies\\nbusiness services[2]\\nthe four major categories of b2b product purchasers are:\\n\\nproducers- use products sold by b2b marketing to make their own goods (e.g.: mattel buying plastics to make toys)\\nresellers- buy b2b products to sell through retail or wholesale establishments (e.g.: walmart buying vacuums to sell in stores)\\ngovernments- buy b2b products for use in government projects (e.g.: purchasing contractor services to repair infrastructure)\\ninstitutions- use b2b products to continue operation (e.g.: schools buying printers for office use)[2]\\nb2c marketing\\nbusiness-to-consumer marketing, or b2c marketing, refers to the tactics and strategies in which a company promotes its products and services to individual people.\\n\\ntraditionally, this could refer to individuals shopping for personal products in a broad sense. more recently the term b2c refers to the online selling of consumer products.[31]\\n\\nc2b marketing\\nconsumer-to-business marketing or c2b marketing is a business model where the end consumers create products and services which are consumed by businesses and organizations. it is diametrically opposed to the popular concept of b2c or business- to- consumer where the companies make goods and services available to the end consumers.\\n\\nc2c marketing\\ncustomer to customer marketing or c2c marketing represents a market environment where one customer purchases goods from another customer using a third-party business or platform to facilitate the transaction. c2c companies are a new type of model that has emerged with e-commerce technology and the sharing economy.[32]\\n\\ndifferences in b2b and b2c marketing\\nthe different goals of b2b and b2c marketing lead to differences in the b2b and b2c markets. the main differences in these markets are demand, purchasing volume, number of customers, customer concentration, distribution, buying nature, buying influences, negotiations, reciprocity, leasing and promotional methods.[2]\\n\\ndemand: b2b demand is derived because businesses buy products based on how much demand there is for the final consumer product. businesses buy products based on customer\\'s wants and needs. b2c demand is primarily because customers buy products based on their own wants and needs.[2]\\npurchasing volume: businesses buy products in large volumes to distribute to consumers. consumers buy products in smaller volumes suitable for personal use.[2]\\nnumber of customers: there are relatively fewer businesses to market to than direct consumers.[2]\\ncustomer concentration: businesses that specialize in a particular market tend to be geographically concentrated while customers that buy products from these businesses are not concentrated.[2]\\ndistribution: b2b products pass directly from the producer of the product to the business while b2c products must additionally go through a wholesaler or retailer.[2]\\nbuying nature: b2b purchasing is a formal process done by professional buyers and sellers, while b2c purchasing is informal.[2]\\nbuying influences: b2b purchasing is influenced by multiple people in various departments such as quality control, accounting, and logistics while b2c marketing is only influenced by the person making the purchase and possibly a few others.[2]\\nnegotiations: in b2b marketing, negotiating for lower prices or added benefits is commonly accepted while in b2c marketing (particularly in western cultures) prices are fixed.[2]\\nreciprocity: businesses tend to buy from businesses they sell to. for example, a business that sells printer ink is more likely to buy office chairs from a supplier that buys the business\\'s printer ink. in b2c marketing, this does not occur because consumers are not also selling products.[2]\\nleasing: businesses tend to lease expensive items while consumers tend to save up to buy expensive items.[2]\\npromotional methods: in b2b marketing, the most common promotional method is personal selling. b2c marketing mostly uses sales promotion, public relations, advertising, and social media.[2]\\nmarketing management orientations\\nmain article: history of marketing § orientations or philosophies that inform marketing practice\\na marketing orientation has been defined as a \"philosophy of business management.\"[3] or \"a corporate state of mind\"[33] or as an \"organisation[al] culture\"[34] although scholars continue to debate the precise nature of specific concepts that inform marketing practice, the most commonly cited orientations are as follows:[35]\\n\\nproduct concept: mainly concerned with the quality of its product. it has largely been supplanted by the marketing orientation, except for haute couture and arts marketing.[36][37]\\nproduction concept: specializes in producing as much as possible of a given product or service in order to achieve

              "'marketing\\nmarketing is the process of intentionally stimulating demand for and purchases of goods and services; potentially including selection of a target audience; selection of certain attributes or themes to emphasize in advertising; operation of advertising campaigns; attendance at trade shows and public events; design of products and packaging to be more attractive to buyers; selection of the terms of sale, such as price, discounts, warranty, and return policy; product placement in media or with people believed to influence the buying habits of others; agreements with retailers, wholesale distributors, or resellers; and attempts to create awareness of, loyalty to, and positive feelings about a brand. marketing is typically conducted by the seller, typically a retailer or manufacturer. sometimes tasks are contracted to a dedicated marketing firm or advertising agency. more rarely, a trade association or government agency (such as the agricultural marketing service) advertises on behalf of an entire industry or locality, often a specific type of food (e.g. got milk?), food from a specific area, or a city or region as a tourism destination.\\n\\nit is one of the primary components of business management and commerce. marketers can direct their product to other businesses (b2b marketing) or directly to consumers (b2c marketing). regardless of who is being marketed to, several factors apply, including the perspective the marketers will use. known as market orientations, they determine how marketers will approach the planning stage of marketing.\\n\\nthe marketing mix, which outlines the specifics of the product and how it will be sold, is affected by the environment surrounding the product, the results of marketing research and market research, and the characteristics of the product\\'s target market. once these factors are determined, marketers must then decide what methods will be used to promote the product, including use of coupons and other price inducements.\\n\\nthe term marketing, what is commonly known as attracting customers, incorporates knowledge gained by studying the management of exchange relationships and is the business process of identifying, anticipating and satisfying customers\\' needs and wants.\\nmarketing is currently defined by the american marketing association (ama) as \"the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large\". however, the definition of marketing has evolved over the years. the ama reviews this definition and its definition for \"marketing research\" every three years. the interests of \"society at large\" were added into the definition in 2008. the development of the definition may be seen by comparing the 2008 definition with the ama\\'s 1935 version: \"marketing is the performance of business activities that direct the flow of goods, and services from producers to consumers\". the newer definition highlights the increased prominence of other stakeholders in the new conception of marketing.\\n\\nrecent definitions of marketing place more emphasis on the consumer relationship, as opposed to a pure exchange process. for instance, prolific marketing author and educator, philip kotler has evolved his definition of marketing. in 1980, he defined marketing as \"satisfying needs and wants through an exchange process\", and in 2018 defined it as \"the process by which companies engage customers, build strong customer relationships, and create customer value in order to capture value from customers in return\". a related definition, from the sales process engineering perspective, defines marketing as \"a set of processes that are interconnected and interdependent with other functions of a business aimed at achieving customer interest and satisfaction\".\\n\\nbesides, customers some definitions of marketing highlight marketing\\'s ability to produce value to shareholders of the firm as well. in this context, marketing can be defined as \"the management process that seeks to maximise returns to shareholders by developing relationships with valued customers and creating a competitive advantage\". for instance, the chartered institute of marketing defines marketing from a customer-centric perspective, focusing on \"the management process responsible for identifying, anticipating and satisfying customer requirements profitably\".\\n\\nin the past, marketing practice tended to be seen as a creative industry, which included advertising, distribution and selling, and even today many parts of the marketing process (e.g. product design, art director, brand management, advertising, inbound marketing, copywriting etc.) involve the use of the creative arts. however, because marketing makes extensive use of social sciences, psychology, sociology, mathematics, economics, anthropology and neuroscience, the profession is now widely recognized as a science. marketing science has developed a concrete process that can be followed to create a marketing plan.\\n\\nthe \"marketing concept\" proposes that to complete its organizational objectives, an organization should anticipate the needs and wants of potential consumers and satisfy them more effectively than its competitors. this concept originated from adam smith\\'s book the wealth of nations but would not become widely used until nearly 200 years later. marketing and marketing concepts are directly related.\\n\\ngiven the centrality of customer needs, and wants in marketing, a rich understanding of these concepts is essential:\\n\\nneeds: something necessary for people to live a healthy, stable and safe life. when needs remain unfulfilled, there is a clear adverse outcome: a dysfunction or death. needs can be objective and physical, such as the need for food, water, and shelter; or subjective and psychological, such as the need to belong to a family or social group and the need for self-esteem.\\nwants: something that is desired, wished for or aspired to. wants are not essential for basic survival and are often shaped by culture or peer-groups.\\ndemands: when needs and wants are backed by the ability to pay, they have the potential to become economic demands.\\nmarketing research, conducted for the purpose of new product development or product improvement, is often concerned with identifying the consumer\\'s unmet needs. customer needs are central to market segmentation which is concerned with dividing markets into distinct groups of buyers on the basis of \"distinct needs, characteristics, or behaviors who might require separate products or marketing mixes.\" needs-based segmentation (also known as benefit segmentation) \"places the customers\\' desires at the forefront of how a company designs and markets products or services.\" although needs-based segmentation is difficult to do in practice, it has been proved to be one of the most effective ways to segment a market. in addition, a great deal of advertising and promotion is designed to show how a given product\\'s benefits meet the customer\\'s needs, wants or expectations in a unique way.\\n\\nb2b and b2c marketing\\nthe two major segments of marketing are business-to-business (b2b) marketing and business-to-consumer (b2c) marketing.\\n\\nb2b marketing\\nb2b (business-to-business) marketing refers to any marketing strategy or content that is geared towards a business or organization. any company that sells products or services to other businesses or organizations (vs. consumers) typically uses b2b marketing strategies.\\n\\nexamples of products sold through b2b marketing include:\\n\\nmajor equipment\\naccessory equipment\\nraw materials\\ncomponent parts\\nprocessed materials\\nsupplies\\nbusiness services\\nthe four major categories of b2b product purchasers are:\\n\\nproducers- use products sold by b2b marketing to make their own goods (e.g.: mattel buying plastics to make toys)\\nresellers- buy b2b products to sell through retail or wholesale establishments (e.g.: walmart buying vacuums to sell in stores)\\ngovernments- buy b2b products for use in government projects (e.g.: purchasing contractor services to repair infrastructure)\\ninstitutions- use b2b products to continue operation (e.g.: schools buying printers for office use)\\nb2c marketing\\nbusiness-to-consumer marketing, or b2c marketing, refers to the tactics and strategies in which a company promotes its products and services to individual people.\\n\\ntraditionally, this could refer to individuals shopping for personal products in a broad sense. more recently the term b2c refers to the online selling of consumer products.\\n\\nc2b marketing\\nconsumer-to-business marketing or c2b marketing is a business model where the end consumers create products and services which are consumed by businesses and organizations. it is diametrically opposed to the popular concept of b2c or business- to- consumer where the companies make goods and services available to the end consumers.\\n\\nc2c marketing\\ncustomer to customer marketing or c2c marketing represents a market environment where one customer purchases goods from another customer using a third-party business or platform to facilitate the transaction. c2c companies are a new type of model that has emerged with e-commerce technology and the sharing economy.\\n\\ndifferences in b2b and b2c marketing\\nthe different goals of b2b and b2c marketing lead to differences in the b2b and b2c markets. the main differences in these markets are demand, purchasing volume, number of customers, customer concentration, distribution, buying nature, buying influences, negotiations, reciprocity, leasing and promotional methods.\\n\\ndemand: b2b demand is derived because businesses buy products based on how much demand there is for the final consumer product. businesses buy products based on customer\\'s wants and needs. b2c demand is primarily because customers buy products based on their own wants and needs.\\npurchasing volume: businesses buy products in large volumes to distribute to consumers. consumers buy products in smaller volumes suitable for personal use.\\nnumber of customers: there are relatively fewer businesses to market to than direct consumers.\\ncustomer concentration: businesses that specialize in a particular market tend to be geographically concentrated while customers that buy products from these businesses are not concentrated.\\ndistribution: b2b products pass directly from the producer of the product to the business while b2c products must additionally go through a wholesaler or retailer.\\nbuying nature: b2b purchasing is a formal process done by professional buyers and sellers, while b2c purchasing is informal.\\nbuying influences: b2b purchasing is influenced by multiple people in various departments such as quality control, accounting, and logistics while b2c marketing is only influenced by the person making the purchase and possibly a few others.\\nnegotiations: in b2b marketing, negotiating for lower prices or added benefits is commonly accepted while in b2c marketing (particularly in western cultures) prices are fixed.\\nreciprocity: businesses tend to buy from businesses they sell to. for example, a business that sells printer ink is more likely to buy office chairs from a supplier that buys the business\\'s printer ink. in b2c marketing, this does not occur because consumers are not also selling products.\\nleasing: businesses tend to lease expensive items while consumers tend to save up to buy expensive items.\\npromotional methods: in b2b marketing, the most common promotional method is personal selling. b2c marketing mostly uses sales promotion, public relations, advertising, and social media.\\nmarketing management orientations\\nmain article: history of marketing § orientations or philosophies that inform marketing practice\\na marketing orientation has been defined as a \"philosophy of business management.\" or \"a corporate state of mind\" or as an \"organisation culture\" although scholars continue to debate the precise nature of specific concepts that inform marketing practice, the most commonly cited orientations are as follows:\\n\\nproduct concept: mainly concerned with the quality of its product. it has largely been supplanted by the marketing orientation, except for haute couture and arts marketing.\\nproduction concept: specializes in producing as much as possible of a given product or service in order to achieve economies of scale or economies of scope. it dominated marketing

on the selling promotion of the firm s existing products, rather than developing new products to satisfy unmet needs or wants primarily through promotion and direct sales techniques, largely for unsought goods in industrial companies. a 2011 meta analyses found that the factors with the greatest impact on sales performance are a salesperson s sales related knowledge (market segments, presentation skills, conflict resolution, and products), degree of adaptiveness, role clarity, cognitive aptitude, motivation and interest in a sales role). marketing concept: this is the most common concept used in contemporary marketing, and is a customer-centric approach based on products that suit new consumer tastes. these firm engage in extensive market research, use r d (research development), and then utilize promotion techniques. the marketing orientation includes: customer orientation: a firm in the market economy can survive by producing goods that people are willing and able to buy. consequently, ascertaining consumer demand is vital for a firm s future viability and even existence as a going concern. organizational orientation: the marketing department is of prime importance within the functional level of an organization. information from the marketing department is used to guide the actions of a company s other departments. a marketing department could ascertain (via marketing research) that consumers desired a new type of product, or a new usage for an existing product. with this in mind, the marketing department would inform the r d department to create a prototype of a product service based on consumers new desires. the production department would then start to manufacture the product. the finance department may oppose required capital expenditures since it could undermine a healthy cash flow for the organization. societal marketing concept: social responsibility that goes beyond satisfying customers and providing superior value embraces societal stakeholders such as employees, customers, and local communities. companies that adopt this perspective typically practice triple bottom line reporting and publish financial, social and environmental impact reports. sustainable marketing or green marketing is an extension of societal marketing. the marketing mix main article: marketing mix a marketing mix is a foundational tool used to guide decision making in marketing. the marketing mix represents the basic tools that marketers can use to bring their products or services to the market. they are the foundation of managerial marketing and the marketing plan typically devotes a section to the marketing mix. the 4cs in response to environmental and technological changes in marketing, as well as criticisms towards the 4ps approach, the 4cs has emerged as a modern marketing mix model. outline consumer (or client) the consumer refers to the person or group that will acquire the product. this aspect of the model focuses on fulfilling the wants or needs of the consumer. cost cost refers to what is exchanged in return for the product. cost mainly consists of the monetary value of the product. cost also refers to anything else the consumer must sacrifice to attain the product, such as time or money spent on transportation to acquire the product. convenience like place in the 4ps model, convenience refers to where the product will be sold. this, however, not only refers to physical stores but also whether the product is available in person or online. the convenience aspect emphasizes making it as easy as possible for the consumer to attain the product, thus making them more likely to do so. communication like promotion in the 4ps model, communication refers to how consumers find out about a product. unlike promotion, communication not only refers to the one-way communication of advertising, but also the two-way communication available through social media.

customers , incorporate knowledge gain study the management exchange relationships the business process identify , anticipate satisfy customers need want . market currently define the american market association ( ama ) the activity , set institutions , process create , communicate , deliver , exchange offer value customers , clients , partner , society large . however , the definition market evolve the years . the ama review definition definition market research every three years . the interest society large add the definition 2008. the development the definition may see compare the 2008 definition the ama 1935 version : market the performance business activities direct the flow goods , service producers consumers . the newer definition highlight the increase prominence stakeholders the new conception market . recent definitions market place emphasis the consumer relationship , oppose pure exchange process . instance , prolific market author educator , philip other evolve

the market concept propose complete organizational objectives , organization anticipate the need want potential consumers satisfy effectively competitors . concept originate adam smith book the wealth nations would become widely use nearly 200 years later . market market concepts directly relate . give the neutrality customer need , want market , rich understand concepts essential : need : something necessary people live healthy , stable safe life . need remain fulfil , clear adverse outcome : dysfunction death . need objective physical , the need food , water , shelter subjective psychological , the need belong family social group the need self-esteem . want : something desire , wish aspire . want essential basic survival often shape culture peer-groups . demand : need want back the ability pay , the potential become economic demand . market research , conduct the purpose new product development product improvement , often concern identify the consumer unset need . customer need central market segmentation concern divide market distinct group buyers the basis distinct need , characteristics , behaviors might require separate products market mix . needs-based segmentation ( also know benefit segmentation ) place the customers desire the forefront company design market products service . although needs-based segmentation difficult practice , prove one the effective ways segment market . addition , great deal advertise promotion design show give product benefit meet the customer need , want expectations unique way . b2b b2c market the two major segment market business-to-business ( b2b ) market business-to-consumer ( b2c ) market . b2b market b2b ( business-to-business ) market refer market strategy content gear towards business organization . company sell products service businesses organizations ( vs. consumers ) typically use b2b market strategies . examples products sell b2b market include : major equipment accessory equipment raw materials component part process materials supply business service the four major categories b2b product purchasers : producers- use products sell b2b market make goods ( e.g . : matter buy plastics make toy ) sellers- buy b2b products sell retail wholesale establishments ( e.g . : walmart buy vacuum sell store ) governments- buy b2b products use government project ( e.g . : purchase contractor service repair infrastructure ) institutions- use b2b products continue operation ( e.g . : school buy printers office use ) b2c market business-to-consumer market , b2c market , refer the tactics strategies company promote products service individual people . traditionally , could refer individuals shop personal products broad sense . recently the term b2c refer the online sell consumer products . c2b market consumer-to-business market c2b market business model the end consumers create products service consume businesses organizations . diametrically oppose the popular concept b2c business- to- consumer the company make goods service available the end consumers . c2c market customer customer market c2c market represent market environment one customer purchase goods another customer use third-party business platform facilitate the transaction . c2c company new type model emerge e-commerce technology the share economy . differences b2b b2c market the different goals b2b b2c market lead differences the b2b b2c market . the main differences market demand , purchase volume , number customers , customer concentration , distribution , buy nature , buy influence , negotiations , reciprocity , lease promotional methods . demand : b2b demand derive businesses buy products base much demand the final consumer product . businesses buy products base customer want need . b2c demand primarily customers buy products base want need . purchase volume : businesses buy products large volumes distribute consumers . consumers buy products smaller volumes suitable personal use . number customers : relatively fewer businesses market direct consumers . customer concentration : businesses specialize particular market tend geographically concentrate customers buy products businesses concentrate . distribution : b2b products pass directly the producer the product the business b2c products must additionally go wholesale retailer . buy nature : b2b purchase formal process do professional buyers sellers , b2c purchase informal . buy influence : b2b purchase influence multiple people various departments quality control , account , logistics b2c market influence the person make the purchase possibly others . negotiations : b2b market , negotiate lower price add benefit commonly accept b2c market ( particularly western culture ) price fix . reciprocity : businesses tend buy businesses sell . example , business sell printer ink likely buy office chair supplier buy the business printer ink . b2c market , occur consumers also sell products . lease : businesses tend lease expensive items consumers tend save buy expensive items . promotional methods : b2b market , the common promotional method personal sell . b2c market mostly use sales promotion , public relations , advertise , social media . market management orientations main article : history market orientations philosophies inform market practice market orientation define philosophy business management . corporate state mind organisation culture although scholars continue debate the precise nature specific concepts inform market practice , the commonly cite orientations follow : product concept : mainly concern the quality product . largely supplant the market orientation , except haute couture arts market . production concept : specialize produce much possible give product service order achieve economies scale economies scope . dominate market practice the 1860s the 1930s , yet still find company industries . specifically , other armstrong note the production philosophy one the oldest philosophies guide sellers ... still useful situations . sell concept : focus the sell promotion the firm exist products , rather develop new products satisfy unset need want primarily promotion direct sales techniques , largely seek goods industrial company . 2011 meta analyse find the factor the greatest impact sales performance salesperson sales relate knowledge ( market segment , presentation skills , conflict resolution , products ) , degree adaptiveness , role clarity , cognitive aptitude , motivation interest sales role ) . market concept : the common concept use contemporary market , customer-centric approach base products suit new consumer taste . firm engage extensive market research , use r ( research development ) , utilize promotion techniques . the market orientation include : customer orientation : firm the market economy survive produce goods people will able buy . consequently , ascertain consumer demand vital firm future viability even existence go concern . organizational orientation : the market department prime importance within the functional level organization . information the market department use guide the action company departments . market department could ascertain ( via market research ) consumers desire new type product , new usage exist product . mind , the market department would inform the r department create prototype product service base consumers new desire . the production department would start manufacture the product . the finance department may oppose require capital expenditures since could undermine healthy cash flow the organization . societal market concept : social responsibility go beyond satisfy customers provide superior value embrace societal stakeholders employees , customers , local communities . company adopt perspective typically practice triple bottom line report publish financial , social environmental impact report . sustainable market green market extension societal market . the market mix main article : market mix market mix foundational tool use guide decision make market . the market mix represent the basic tool marketers use bring products service the market . the foundation managerial market the market plan typically devote section the market mix . the 4cs response environmental technological change market , well criticisms towards the 4ps approach , the 4cs emerge modern market mix model . outline consumer ( client ) the consumer refer the person group acquire the product . aspect the model focus fulfil the want need the consumer . cost cost refer exchange return the product . cost mainly consist the monetary value the product . cost also refer anything else the consumer must sacrifice attain the product , time money spend transportation acquire the product . convenience like place the 4ps model , convenience refer the product sell . , however , refer physical store also whether the product available person online . the convenience aspect emphasize make easy possible the consumer attain the product , thus make likely . communication like promotion the 4ps model , communication refer consumers find product . unlike promotion , communication refer the one-way communication advertise , also the two-way communication available social media .
